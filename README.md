Amazon Clone Project

Introduction

Welcome to the Amazon Clone project! This project is a hands-on implementation of an Amazon-like e-commerce website using HTML and CSS. The project was created by following the detailed instructions provided in a YouTube video by Shraddha Khapra on the apna College channel. Shraddha not only covers the basics of HTML and CSS but also delves deeply into understanding a website's content, its underlying technology, and the intricacies of inspecting a website.
